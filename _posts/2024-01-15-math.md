title: "Understanding Fenchel conjugate"

One of the first things I realized by approaching convex analysis is the importance of notation. The use of simple symbols or tiny marks adjustements to encapsulate different topics, sometimes even a wide class of problems, is crucial to develop extremely powerful mathematical primitives. The [Fenchel conjugate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_conjugate) is a perfect example of this concept: even it might look mysterious at first sight it is one of the most important primitives in duality theory.
