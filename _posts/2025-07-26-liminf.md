In the early stages of studying convex analysis, the concepts of upper and lower semicontinuity often present significant challenges. While these properties are introduced as generalizations of continuity at a point, I think that the main source of confusion are the operators involved in their definitions, lim-inf and lim-sup, which can appear obscure and unintuitive. The aim of this article is not to provide a rigorous or formal treatment of these operators, but rather to offer some practical intuition that may help clarify the true meaning of the lim-inf operator in particular, due to its relevance in understanding the property of lower-semicontinutiy of a function.

The lim-inf operator was originally introduced for sequences: mathematicians wanted a primitive that could capture the asymptotic behavior of sequences which didn't converge in the usual sense but oscillate or fluctuate within certain bounds. Later, this operator was extended and generalized to functions, providing a way to analyze the behavior of function values as the input approaches a specific point in the domain.

## [Definition (for sequences)](#definition-seq)
Given a sequence of values $$(x_n)$$, the lim-inf operator is defined as 

$$
\liminf_{n\to\infty} x_n = \sup_{n\geq 0} \inf_{m\geq n} x_m
$$

In words, this is typically referred as *the greatest lower bound of *
